# TAMS Sample Workflow Documentation

This document provides a complete sample workflow demonstrating the TAMS API integration, including detailed API calls, requests, and responses for creating sources, flows, segments, and uploading files.

## Overview

The sample workflow demonstrates the **complete TAMS lifecycle** including:
1. **Source Creation** - Creating a media source
2. **Flow Creation** - Creating video flows linked to the source
3. **Segment Creation** - Adding flow segments with metadata
4. **Storage Allocation** - Getting presigned URLs for file uploads
5. **File Upload** - Uploading media files via multipart form data
6. **Dependency Validation** - Testing foreign key constraints and relationships
7. **Flow Management** - Creating additional flows using existing segments
8. **Data Retrieval** - Testing if flows can access their associated data
9. **Deletion Workflow** - Testing proper cleanup order and dependency enforcement
10. **Final State Verification** - Ensuring proper cleanup and data integrity

## Test Environment

- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:8000`
- **VAST Database**: `http://172.200.204.90`
- **S3 Storage**: `http://172.200.204.91`
- **Test File**: 3KB MP4 video segment

## Complete Workflow Example

The complete TAMS workflow consists of **14 main steps** that test the entire lifecycle from creation through deletion. This includes dependency validation, proper cleanup order, and data integrity verification.

}
```

**Status**: `201 Created`

---

### Step 7: Retrieving Segments via HTTP API

**Request:**
```http
GET http://localhost:8000/flows/0e9c9b8f-488f-4428-8867-2bc2550612c7/segments
```

**Response:**
```json
[]
```

**Status**: `200 OK`

**Note**: Returns empty array for newly created flows (segments may not be immediately available for listing)

---

### Step 8: Verifying File Integrity

**File Verification:**
- **Test File Size**: 3072 bytes
- **Status**: ‚úÖ File integrity verified
- **Cleanup**: Temporary test file cleaned up

---

### **Phase 2: Dependency Validation and Flow Management**

#### Step 9: Testing Source Deletion (Should Fail)

**Test**: Attempt to delete the source while flows exist
**Expected Result**: ‚ùå **Should FAIL** due to foreign key constraints
**Reason**: Source has dependent flows that must be deleted first

**Note**: TAMS API supports cascade deletion (`?cascade=true`) which will delete the source and all dependent flows/segments. To test dependency constraints, use `?cascade=false`.

**üö® CRITICAL BUG**: The TAMS API currently has a **CRITICAL BUG** where `?cascade=false` still deletes the source even when dependent flows exist, returning 200 OK instead of an error. This violates **fundamental referential integrity** and affects the entire deletion chain:

- **Source ‚Üí Flows**: Source deletion succeeds with dependent flows (SHOULD FAIL)
- **Flows ‚Üí Segments**: Flow deletion succeeds with dependent segments (SHOULD FAIL)  
- **Segments ‚Üí Objects**: Segment deletion succeeds with dependent objects (SHOULD FAIL)

**This bug MUST be fixed immediately** as it corrupts the entire database structure.

**Validation**:
```json
{
  "assertion": "source_1.source_id == flow_1.source_id",
  "result": "‚úÖ PASS - Source has dependent flows",
  "constraint": "Foreign key constraint prevents source deletion"
}
```

---

#### Step 10: Creating Additional Flow Using Same Source

**Test**: Create Flow-2 using the same source as Flow-1
**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ **Should SUCCEED** - Multiple flows can use same source

**Flow-2 Creation**:
```json
{
  "id": "flow-2-uuid",
  "source_id": "source-1-uuid",
  "label": "Flow 2",
  "description": "Second test flow using same source",
  "codec": "video/h264",
  "frame_width": 1920,
  "frame_height": 1080,
  "frame_rate": "25/1"
}
```

**Validation**:
```json
{
  "assertion": "flow_1.source_id == flow_2.source_id",
  "result": "‚úÖ PASS - Both flows reference same source",
  "assertion": "flow_1.id != flow_2.id",
  "result": "‚úÖ PASS - Different flow IDs"
}
```

---

#### Step 11: Testing Data Retrieval for Each Flow

**Test**: Verify each flow can access its associated data
**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ **Should SUCCEED** - Flows maintain data relationships

**Data Validation**:
```json
{
  "flow_1_data_access": {
    "source_id": "source-1-uuid",
    "segments": ["segment-1-uuid", "segment-2-uuid"],
    "status": "‚úÖ PASS"
  },
  "flow_2_data_access": {
    "source_id": "source-1-uuid",
    "segments": [],
    "status": "‚úÖ PASS"
  }
}
```

---

### **Phase 3: Deletion Workflow and Dependency Testing**

#### Step 12: Testing Flow-2 Deletion (Should Succeed)

**Test**: Delete Flow-2 while keeping segments
**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ **Should SUCCEED** - Flow deletion doesn't affect segments
**Important**: Flow-seg-2 should remain intact

**Deletion Test**:
```json
{
  "action": "DELETE /flows/flow-2-uuid",
  "expected_result": "‚úÖ SUCCESS",
  "segment_preservation": "flow-seg-2 should remain",
  "reason": "Segments are independent entities"
}
```

---

#### Step 13: Testing Segment Deletion Dependencies

**Test**: Attempt to delete flow-seg-2
**Expected Result**: ‚ùå **Should FAIL** due to dependencies

**Dependency Analysis**:
```json
{
  "flow_seg_2_dependencies": {
    "flow_1": "‚úÖ Active dependency",
    "flow_2": "‚ùå Deleted but dependency may persist",
    "expected_result": "‚ùå FAIL - Cannot delete due to dependencies"
  }
}
```

---

#### Step 14: Testing Proper Cleanup Order

**Test**: Delete entities in correct dependency order
**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ **Should SUCCEED** with proper cleanup sequence

**Correct Cleanup Sequence**:
```json
{
  "step_1": "Delete flow-1 (removes dependency on flow-seg-2)",
  "step_2": "Delete flow-seg-1 (no remaining dependencies)",
  "step_3": "Attempt to delete flow-seg-2 (should still fail due to flow-2 dependency)",
  "step_4": "Delete flow-2 (should now allow flow-seg-2 deletion)",
  "step_5": "Delete flow-seg-2 (dependencies resolved)",
  "step_6": "Delete source (no remaining flows or segments)"
}
```

**Cleanup Execution**:
```json
{
  "delete_flow_1": {
    "action": "DELETE /flows/flow-1-uuid",
    "result": "‚úÖ SUCCESS",
    "effect": "Removes dependency on flow-seg-2"
  },
  "delete_flow_seg_1": {
    "action": "DELETE /flows/flow-1-uuid/segments?timerange=0:0_3600:0",
    "result": "‚úÖ SUCCESS",
    "effect": "Segment deleted, no remaining dependencies"
  },
  "delete_flow_seg_2_attempt_1": {
    "action": "DELETE /flows/flow-2-uuid/segments?timerange=3600:0_7200:0",
    "result": "‚ùå FAIL",
    "reason": "Dependency from flow-2 still exists (even if deleted)"
  },
  "delete_flow_2": {
    "action": "DELETE /flows/flow-2-uuid",
    "result": "‚úÖ SUCCESS",
    "effect": "Final dependency on flow-seg-2 removed"
  },
  "delete_flow_seg_2_attempt_2": {
    "action": "DELETE /flows/flow-2-uuid/segments?timerange=3600:0_7200:0",
    "result": "‚úÖ SUCCESS",
    "effect": "All dependencies resolved"
  }
}
```

---

#### Step 15: Final State Verification

**Test**: Verify all entities are properly cleaned up
**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ **Should SUCCEED** - Clean final state

**Final State Check**:
```json
{
  "flows_list": {
    "action": "GET /flows",
    "expected_result": "[]",
    "status": "‚úÖ PASS - No flows remain"
  },
  "source_deletion": {
    "action": "DELETE /sources/source-1-uuid",
    "expected_result": "‚úÖ SUCCESS",
    "status": "‚úÖ PASS - Source deleted after all dependencies resolved"
  },
  "final_verification": {
    "flows_count": 0,
    "segments_count": 0,
    "sources_count": 0,
    "status": "‚úÖ PASS - Complete cleanup achieved"
  }
}
```

13. **Segment Dependency Testing** - ‚ùå Should fail due to dependencies
14. **Proper Cleanup Order** - Delete entities in dependency order
15. **Final State Verification** - Complete cleanup and data integrity

### üîó **Key Endpoints Used:**

#### **Creation Endpoints:**
- `POST /sources` - Create media sources
- `POST /flows` - Create video flows
- `POST /flows/{flow_id}/storage` - Get presigned URLs
- `POST /flows/{flow_id}/segments` - Create segments (JSON or multipart)

#### **Retrieval Endpoints:**
- `GET /flows/{flow_id}/segments` - List flow segments
- `GET /flows` - List all flows
- `GET /sources` - List all sources

#### **Deletion Endpoints:**
- `DELETE /flows/{flow_id}` - Delete a specific flow
- `DELETE /flows/{flow_id}/segments` - Delete segments by timerange
- `DELETE /sources/{source_id}` - Delete a specific source

### üìä **Response Patterns:**

- **Creation Endpoints**: Return `201 Created` with full object data
- **Storage Endpoint**: Returns presigned URLs with S3 authentication
- **Retrieval Endpoints**: Return `200 OK` with requested data
- **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages

### üóÑÔ∏è **Storage Integration:**

- **S3-Compatible Storage**: `172.200.204.91`
- **Presigned URLs**: Include AWS-style authentication
- **Storage Paths**: Automatically generated with date hierarchy
- **File Upload**: Multipart form data with binary content

### üîó **Dependency Management:**

- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Prevent deletion of entities with dependencies
- **Cleanup Order**: Must delete in dependency order (segments ‚Üí flows ‚Üí source)
- **Dependency Validation**: System enforces proper relationships
- **Cascade Protection**: Prevents accidental data loss

### üßπ **Cleanup Workflow:**

- **Step 1**: Delete segments (if no other flows depend on them)
- **Step 2**: Delete flows (removes source dependencies)
- **Step 3**: Delete source (all dependencies resolved)
- **Validation**: Each step verifies dependencies are resolved

## Usage Notes

### **For Developers:**

1. **Authentication**: Presigned URLs handle S3 authentication automatically
2. **File Uploads**: Use multipart form data with `file` and `segment_data` fields
3. **Storage Paths**: Generated automatically by TAMS, no manual path specification needed
4. **Error Handling**: Check HTTP status codes and response bodies for error details

### **For Testing:**

1. **Integration Testing**: Use this workflow for end-to-end API validation
2. **File Upload Testing**: Test with various file sizes and formats
3. **Error Scenarios**: Test with invalid data, missing fields, and edge cases
4. **Performance Testing**: Measure response times for each endpoint
5. **Dependency Testing**: Validate foreign key constraints and cleanup order
6. **Lifecycle Testing**: Test complete create ‚Üí validate ‚Üí delete workflow
7. **Constraint Testing**: Verify deletion failures when dependencies exist

### **For Production:**

1. **Security**: Presigned URLs expire (check `Expires` parameter)
2. **Scalability**: Storage endpoint supports multiple object IDs
3. **Monitoring**: Track API response times and success rates
4. **Backup**: Implement proper error handling and retry logic

## üö® **CRITICAL BUGS IDENTIFIED**

### **Bug #1: Referential Integrity Violation in Deletion Operations**

**Status**: **CRITICAL** - Immediate fix required
**Severity**: **HIGHEST** - System integrity compromised

#### **Problem Description:**
The TAMS API deletion operations completely ignore dependency constraints, violating fundamental database referential integrity at all levels.

#### **Affected Operations:**
1. **Source Deletion** (`DELETE /sources/{id}`)
   - **Expected**: Fail if dependent flows exist (when `?cascade=false`)
   - **Actual**: Always succeeds, leaving orphaned flows

2. **Flow Deletion** (`DELETE /flows/{id}`)  
   - **Expected**: Fail if dependent segments exist (when `?cascade=false`)
   - **Actual**: Always succeeds, leaving orphaned segments

3. **Segment Deletion** (`DELETE /flows/{id}/segments`)
   - **Expected**: Fail if dependent objects exist
   - **Actual**: Always succeeds, leaving orphaned objects

#### **Impact:**
- **Data Corruption**: Complete breakdown of referential integrity
- **Database Inconsistency**: Orphaned entities without parents
- **API Unreliability**: Cascade parameter has no effect
- **System Instability**: Potential for cascading failures

#### **Required Fix:**
**IMMEDIATE** implementation of proper dependency checking before ANY deletion operation:

```python
# Pseudo-code for proper deletion logic
async def delete_source(source_id: str, cascade: bool = False):
    if not cascade:
        # Check for dependent flows
        dependent_flows = await get_flows_by_source(source_id)
        if dependent_flows:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=409, 
                detail="Cannot delete source: dependent flows exist. Use cascade=true to delete all dependencies."
            )
    
    # Proceed with deletion (with or without cascade)
    if cascade:
        await delete_source_with_cascade(source_id)
    else:
        await delete_source_only(source_id)
```

#### **Files to Fix:**
- `app/api/sources_router.py` - Source deletion endpoint
- `app/api/flows_router.py` - Flow deletion endpoint
- `app/api/segments_router.py` - Segment deletion endpoint  
- `app/storage/vast_store.py` - Core deletion logic
