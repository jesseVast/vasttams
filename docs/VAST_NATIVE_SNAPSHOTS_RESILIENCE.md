# VAST Native Snapshots for TAMS Resilience and Data Protection

## Overview

This document outlines the recommended approach for implementing resilience and data protection in the TAMS (Time Addressable Media Store) application using VAST Native snapshots instead of application-level resilience mechanisms. VAST Native snapshots provide a more robust, performant, and integrated solution for both database and S3 storage resilience.

## Why VAST Native Snapshots?

### Advantages Over Application-Level Resilience

1. **Native Consistency**: VAST snapshots ensure database and S3 consistency at the storage layer
2. **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Ability to restore to any specific point in time
3. **Performance**: No application overhead during normal operations
4. **Integration**: Seamless integration with VAST's distributed architecture
5. **Scalability**: Handles large datasets without performance degradation
6. **Automation**: Can be automated and integrated with backup policies

### Previous Approach Limitations

The previous application-level resilience approach had several limitations:
- **Performance Impact**: Additional S3 operations during normal workflows
- **Complexity**: Application code complexity for backup management
- **Inconsistency Risk**: Potential for database and S3 state mismatches
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Custom backup logic requiring ongoing maintenance

## VAST Native Snapshot Architecture

### Database Snapshots

VAST provides native database snapshot capabilities that capture the complete state of the database at a specific point in time.

#### Key Features:
- **Atomic Operations**: Snapshots are created atomically, ensuring consistency
- **Incremental**: Only changed data is captured in subsequent snapshots
- **Compression**: Efficient storage with built-in compression
- **Retention Policies**: Configurable retention and cleanup policies

#### Configuration Example:
```yaml
# VAST database snapshot configuration
snapshots:
  retention:
    daily: 7      # Keep daily snapshots for 7 days
    weekly: 4     # Keep weekly snapshots for 4 weeks
    monthly: 12   # Keep monthly snapshots for 12 months
  compression: true
  encryption: true
  schedule:
    daily: "02:00"    # Daily at 2 AM
    weekly: "Sunday 03:00"  # Weekly on Sunday at 3 AM
    monthly: "1st 04:00"    # Monthly on 1st at 4 AM
```

### S3 Storage Snapshots

VAST's S3-compatible storage also supports native snapshots that capture the complete state of S3 buckets and objects.

#### Key Features:
- **Bucket-Level Snapshots**: Capture entire bucket states
- **Object Consistency**: Ensure all objects are captured consistently
- **Metadata Preservation**: Complete metadata and tagging preservation
- **Cross-Region Replication**: Support for disaster recovery across regions

#### Configuration Example:
```yaml
# VAST S3 snapshot configuration
s3_snapshots:
  buckets:
    - name: "tams-media-bucket"
      retention: 30  # days
      compression: true
      encryption: true
      cross_region_replication:
        enabled: true
        destination: "us-west-2"
  schedule:
    frequency: "6h"  # Every 6 hours
    start_time: "00:00"
```
