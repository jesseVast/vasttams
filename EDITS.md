# Code Changes and Edits

## December 2024

### Ibis Predicate Conversion Fix - RESOLVED ✅
**Issue**: WARNING: Could not convert Ibis predicate (_.deleted.isnull() | (_.deleted == False)): unhashable type: 'Deferred'

**Root Cause**: The `_add_soft_delete_predicate` method in `vast_store.py` was creating Ibis predicates using `ibis._` (which creates `Deferred` objects), but then the `VastDBManager.select()` method was trying to convert these back to Python dictionaries, which failed because `Deferred` objects are unhashable.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Enhanced PredicateBuilder** (`app/storage/vastdbmanager/queries/predicate_builder.py`):
   - Added `convert_ibis_predicate_to_vast()` method that converts Ibis predicates to VAST-compatible dictionary format
   - Implemented `_parse_predicate_string()` method that parses predicate string representations to avoid Deferred object issues
   - Added support for complex predicates including AND, OR operations, and soft delete scenarios
   - Handles nested parentheses and various predicate formats

2. **Updated VastDBManager** (`app/storage/vastdbmanager/core.py`):
   - Modified `select()` method to use the new predicate converter instead of manual conversion
   - Updated `update()` method to also use the new predicate converter
   - Improved error handling and logging for predicate conversion

3. **Fixed VAST Store** (`app/storage/vast_store.py`):
   - Updated `_add_soft_delete_predicate()` method to create dictionary-based predicates instead of Ibis objects
   - This avoids the Deferred type conversion issue entirely
   - Maintains backward compatibility for existing Ibis predicates

**Files Modified**:
- `app/storage/vastdbmanager/queries/predicate_builder.py` - Added predicate conversion methods
- `app/storage/vastdbmanager/core.py` - Updated select/update methods
- `app/storage/vast_store.py` - Fixed soft delete predicate creation
- `tests/test_vastdbmanager_architecture.py` - Added comprehensive predicate conversion tests

**Testing**: All VastDBManager architecture tests passing, including new predicate conversion tests.

**Result**: The unhashable Deferred type warnings are now resolved, and soft delete filtering works correctly without data leakage.

### Proper Update/Delete Implementation - COMPLETED ✅
**Issue**: Update method was doing insert instead of update, delete method was a no-op

**Root Cause**: Incorrect assumption that VAST doesn't support native UPDATE/DELETE operations. The previous implementation was based on the assumption that VAST only supports INSERT operations.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **VAST-Native UPDATE Operations** (`app/storage/vastdbmanager/core.py`):
   - Updated `update()` method to use VAST's native UPDATE capability
   - Method now fetches `$row_id` field first using `query_with_predicates(include_row_ids=True)`
   - Creates proper PyArrow RecordBatch with `$row_id` field as required by VAST
   - Uses `vast_table.update(record_batch)` for native VAST updates
   - Handles both single values and lists of values for batch updates

2. **VAST-Native DELETE Operations** (`app/storage/vastdbmanager/core.py`):
   - Updated `delete()` method to use VAST's native DELETE capability
   - Method fetches `$row_id` field first using `query_with_predicates(include_row_ids=True)`
   - Creates proper PyArrow RecordBatch with only `$row_id` field as required by VAST
   - Uses `vast_table.delete(record_batch)` for native VAST deletes

3. **Enhanced Query Method** (`app/storage/vastdbmanager/core.py`):
   - Fixed `query_with_predicates()` method signature to be more logical: `(table_name, predicates, columns, limit, include_row_ids)`
   - Added `include_row_ids` parameter to automatically include `$row_id` field when needed
   - Fixed parameter order to match actual usage patterns
   - Updated all calling code to use new parameter order

4. **Removed Helper Methods**:
   - Removed `_soft_delete_records()` and `_perform_actual_update()` methods
   - These were no longer needed since we're using VAST's native capabilities

**Files Modified**:
- `app/storage/vastdbmanager/core.py` - Complete rewrite of update/delete methods, enhanced query method
- `test_vast_optimization.py` - Fixed parameter order in method calls
- `test_data_insertion.py` - Fixed parameter order in method calls  
- `test_row_pooling.py` - Fixed parameter order in method calls

**Testing**: All VastDBManager architecture tests passing, including predicate conversion tests.

**Result**: VAST now properly supports full CRUD operations using native UPDATE and DELETE capabilities as documented in the [VAST Data documentation](https://vast-data.github.io/data-platform-field-docs/vast_database/sdk_ref/08_manipulation.html). The system no longer creates duplicate records or performs no-op delete operations.
