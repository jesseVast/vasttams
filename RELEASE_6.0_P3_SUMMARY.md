# Release 6.0_p3 Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Release Overview

**Release Date**: August 27, 2025  
**Branch**: `release_6.0_p3`  
**Commit**: `bfe4771`  
**Status**: âœ… Complete and Tested

## ðŸš€ Major Improvements

### 1. Critical Bug Fixes

#### Timerange Parsing Enhancement
- **Issue**: S3 object key generation was failing for ISO 8601 timeranges, defaulting to current date
- **Fix**: Enhanced `_generate_segment_key` method to handle both TAMS-specific and ISO 8601 formats
- **Impact**: S3 object keys now use correct timerange dates instead of current date
- **Result**: Eliminates 403/404 errors when accessing segments

#### Dynamic URL Generation
- **Issue**: Pre-signed URLs were generated even for non-existent S3 objects
- **Fix**: Added S3 object existence check before URL generation in `create_get_urls`
- **Impact**: URLs only generated for existing objects, preventing misleading responses
- **Result**: More reliable and accurate URL generation

#### HEAD Request Support
- **Issue**: HEAD requests to GET URLs returned 403 Forbidden
- **Fix**: Generate separate pre-signed URLs for GET and HEAD operations
- **Impact**: Both GET and HEAD operations now work correctly
- **Result**: Full HTTP method support for segment access

#### Object Reuse Optimization
- **Issue**: Multiple segments referencing same object created duplicate S3 storage
- **Fix**: Enhanced object management to detect and reuse existing content
- **Impact**: Efficient storage usage and faster segment creation
- **Result**: Better performance and storage efficiency

### 2. Documentation Restructuring

#### Split Large README.md
- **Before**: Single, unwieldy README.md (1000+ lines)
- **After**: Focused, maintainable documentation structure
- **Files Created**:
  - `README.md` - High-level overview and quick start

  - `API_REFERENCE.md` - Complete API endpoint documentation
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical architecture and design patterns
  - `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment and configuration guides
  - `NOTES.md` - Project notes and status tracking

#### Benefits of New Structure
- **Maintainability**: Each file has a single, focused purpose
- **Discoverability**: Users can find specific information quickly
- **Collaboration**: Multiple contributors can work on different docs simultaneously
- **Version Control**: Smaller files make changes easier to track
- **User Experience**: Clear separation of concerns improves readability

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Details

### S3 Store Enhancements (`app/s3_store.py`)

#### `_generate_segment_key` Method
```python
async def _generate_segment_key(self, flow_id: str, segment_id: str, timerange: str) -> str:
    # Enhanced to parse both TAMS and ISO 8601 formats
    # Falls back to current time with warning if parsing fails
```

#### `create_get_urls` Method
```python
async def create_get_urls(self, flow_id: str, segment_id: str, timerange: str) -> List[GetUrl]:
    # Generates both GET and HEAD URLs for existing S3 objects only
    # Performs existence check before URL generation
```
